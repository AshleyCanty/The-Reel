# TheReel
TheReel is an iOS app built using Swift. It allows users to seek movies by fetching data from The MovieDB API. The data is presented to users using both UITableView and UICollectionView. Users have the option of either sharing movie details or saving the movie under their list of "favorites", which is managed by Core Data.
